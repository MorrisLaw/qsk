# Quantum Soft Keyboard

The keyboard remapping software you never knew you wanted.

Inspired by an open source keyboard firmware project called QMK, the goal of
`qsk` is to elide the requirement that invest in a niche hobbyist keyboard in
order to access interesting features such as:

* standard keyboard remappings
* "macros", ie key sequences and chords generated by singular keypresses
* overlapping "layers" of mappings and various macros to activate them
